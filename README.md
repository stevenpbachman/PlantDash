## Data dashboard for Plants on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species


This repository contains code used to create a [Flexdashboard](https://spbachman.shinyapps.io/plantdash) using data from the [IUCN Red List](https://www.iucnredlist.org/) on the Plant kingdom.


The dashboard was built becaue there is a need to monitor status and trends in Plant Red Listing. The dashboard accompanies a manuscript (submitted) for the paper: **"Progress, challenges and opportunities for Red Listing"**.

Work is in progress - check [issues](https://github.com/stevenpbachman/plantdash/issues) for to do list or add your suggestions.
